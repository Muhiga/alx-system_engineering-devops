echo 'Best School' > $'\052\\'"Best School"$'\047\\'$'\052\\'$'\077\\'$'\052\\'$'\052\\'$'\052\\'$'\052\\'$'\072\\'
In this script, we are using ANSI-C Quoting to escape the special characters in the file name. The $'\052' syntax represents the octal value of the asterisk character, and similarly, $'\047' represents the octal value of the single quote character, and so on.

#!/bin/bash
ls -la > ls_cwd_content
The > operator will redirect the output of the ls -la command to the file ls_cwd_content, overwriting any existing contents. If the file does not exist, it will be created.
#!/bin/bash
last_line=$(tail -n1 iacta)
echo "$last_line" >> iacta
This script uses the tail command with the -n1 option to extract the last line of the file iacta, and stores it in the variable last_line. It then appends the contents of last_line to the end of the iacta file using the >> operator.
